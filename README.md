# OmniChat

A simple chat app built with Flask and SocketIO. Uses SQLAlchemy.

From devs, to devs.

**Note: This project is still WIP.**

## Setting up the server

Firstly, install the requirements in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the development server with the following command:

```bash
$ python ./app.py
```

*Note: Do **NOT** use `flask run` because it won't handle SocketIO requests.*
